**🧽 SpongeBob: Patty Panic (Fan Game)**

SpongeBob: Patty Panic is a fast-paced, fun fan-made mini-game where SpongeBob races against time to collect all the Krabby Patties scattered around Bikini Bottom—before Plankton catches him!

You play as SpongeBob, who must gather patties under a strict countdown timer. If the timer reaches 00:00 before you collect them all, you lose. But Plankton isn’t making things easy—he’s roaming around trying to stop SpongeBob from finishing his mission.

To keep things exciting, the game includes a shrink ray mechanic: SpongeBob can use a gun that temporarily shrinks him down to Plankton’s size, allowing him to dodge obstacles, sneak into tight spaces, and escape danger.
